    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted posts are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit.\n",

    "We will analyse posts whose title begin with either `Ask HN`or `Show HN`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Ask HN`posts are used to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.\n",
    "- `Show HN` posts are used to show the Hacker News community a project, product or something generally interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set can be found in [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the data set we're working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",

    "## Sum up\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we have analysed data from the technology site Hacker News to find out the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "After looking into the data, we have seen that `Ask HN` posts receive 4 more comments on average than `Show HN` posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The posts that receive more comments are the ones created between 3pm and 4pm for `Ask HN` posts and between 6pm and 7pm for `Show HN` posts, both in Eastern Time.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it should be noted that the data set we analysed excluded posts without any comments. Given that, it's more accurate to say that our conclusions only apply to the posts that received comments."
